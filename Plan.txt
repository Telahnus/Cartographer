Cartographer Plan

idea: upload image, add markers, let others view

minimum: login, upload image, add markers, viewable url

index / home page
	login
	forgot password
	about
	register
login
	username, password, email
	save in DB
		make sure to test/secure
		which DB?
splash (after login)
	list of maps
	upload new map base
		ground overlay on map
		where to save?
		generates custom url for viewing
map edit
	zoom/pan
		gmap built in functionality
	create/edit markers
		save data to sql?
	layers
	draw functions? (lines, squares, etc)
		may be built in gmap
map view
	toggle layers
	zoom/pan
	view markers

using pop.co as domain
	campaign-cartographer.co
google cloud platform?
firebase DB?
mongo DB?

	viewreset 	Event 	Fired when the map needs to redraw its content (this usually happens on map zoom or load). Very useful for creating custom overlays.

fuck nosql db's, no firebase, no mongo, just mysql, php, js, html and css
